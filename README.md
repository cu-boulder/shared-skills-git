Learning to use Github for documentation, collaboration, revision and version control

This repository is designed to teach the use of github for collaboration, communication, and documentation.  This class is a combination of a classroom and an asynchronous exercise.

If at any point you need help please reach out to one of the mentors listed [here](./mentors.md).  If you'd like to volunteer as mentor add you name to the list.

## Setup
1.  Install Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2.  If you are just getting started with Github install Github Desktop instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop)
  * If you are comfortable with typing into a terminal and/or would like to maintain continuity with the DataCamp class you can use a [terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Terminal).  Instructions for getting setup with the "typing" version of Github are [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart)
3.  If you have not already done so in the earlier steps sign up for a free Github account here [here](https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home).  
  * Once you have and account and are actively using Github we can add you to the ODA Organization on Github.  Our public projects are [here](https://github.com/cu-boulder)
  * Send Seth your github name and he will give you permission to write to the repository.

## Explore
1. Explore to get a sense of what of what Github and how its used.  I found a few interesting repositiories:
  * https://github.com/shilohbradley: An IR Person from UNLV with profile includes some code for IPEDS analysis.
  * https://github.com/jasonpcasey: Some intersting higher-ed datasets, seems like an IR person.
  * https://github.com/unl-iea: University of Nebraska IR
  * https://github.com/MIT-IR: MIT IR, not much thats useful
  * https://github.com/nietsnel/institutional-research: An older repo explaining the value of R for an IR team
  * https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data COVID-19 Data
2. Somebody with the handle jbryer crearted a R library for downloading data from IPEDS.  The code is [here](https://github.com/jbryer/ipeds), if you look at the issues you'll see a few people have run into a problems and have asked for help.
3. I use my personal Github account to share code that I think might be useful to others.  The examples below show projects that have comments, issues, and have been used by other people.  I posted a project for visualing the output from a kind of neural network [here](https://github.com/geoss/som_visualization_r).  That public repository attracted some conversation [here](https://github.com/geoss/som_visualization_r/issues?q=).  At one point the code broke and some guy in the Netherlands fixed it.  By clicking on number next to the fork symbol one can see who has been using the code. 

## Do Stuff 
1. [Exercise 1 involves adding a file to this repository](./exercise-1.md)
2. [Exercise 2 involves collectively editing a file by creating a branch, submitting a pull request, and creating an issue](./exercise-2.md).  **Do not begin exercise 2 until its your turn, you will recieve a notification to start.**

### Additional resources
1.  I created a little youtube video demonstrating how to use GitHub within viual studio [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3zQyQ5JVnU&feature=youtu.be)
