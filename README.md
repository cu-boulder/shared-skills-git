Learning to use Github for documentation, collaboration, revision and version control

This repository is designed to teach the use of github for collaboration, communication, and documentation.  This class is a combination of a classroom and an asynchronous exercise.

## Setup
1.  Install Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2.  If you are just getting started with Github install Github Desktop instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop)
  * If you are comfortable with typing into a terminal and/or would like to maintain continuity with the DataCamp class you can use a [terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Terminal).  Instructions for getting setup with the "typing" version of Github are [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart)
3.  If you have not already done so in the earlier steps sign up for a free Github account here [here](https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home).  
  * Once you have and account and are actively using Github we can add you to the ODA Organization on Github.  Our public projects are [here](https://github.com/cu-boulder)

## Explore
1. Explore to get a sense of what of what Github and how its used.  I found a few interesting repositiories:
  * https://github.com/shilohbradley: An IR Person from UNLV with profile includes some code for IPEDS analysis.
  * https://github.com/jasonpcasey: Some intersting higher-ed datasets, seems like an IR person.
  * https://github.com/unl-iea: University of Nebraska IR
  * https://github.com/MIT-IR: MIT IR, not much thats useful
  * https://github.com/nietsnel/institutional-research: An older repo explaining the value of R for an IR team
  * https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data COVID-19 Data
2. My personal github account is somethign I use to share code that I think might be useful to others.  The examples below show projects that have comments, issues, and have been used by other people.   
  * In my personal github account I posted a project for visualing the output from a kind of neural network [here](https://github.com/geoss/som_visualization_r).  That public repository attracted some conversation [here](https://github.com/geoss/som_visualization_r/issues?q=).  At one point recently the code broke and some guy in the Netherlands fixed it.
  * An example of a tool I made to process census data [here](https://github.com/geoss/censumander).  It has a bug and needs to be updated, and the issues reflect this.
