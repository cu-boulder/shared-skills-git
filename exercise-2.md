# Exercise 2
At this point we have all contributed to the repository however to different files.  In part two of this exercise we will collectively edit a single document.

This part of the exercise demonstrates the utility of Github for collectively editing files but its also shows how one can formalize workflows using the tool.  

You will be greating **branches** and using **pull requests** to merge those beanches back into the main branch. 

**DO NOT BEGIN THIS EXERCISE UNTIL YOU HAVE RECIEVED A NOTIFACTION THAT IT'S YOUR TURN**

1. Make sure your version of the repository is upto date (using either the desktop app or the command line).
2. You will recieve a notification when it is your turn to edit.
3. Once its your turn, create a new branch called lastname_firstname (e.g. dylan_bob)
3. Edit `ourfile.md` file by visting the most recently added wikiprdia page (the link above your name).  Add a wikipedia link next to your name.  However, the page you add must be reachable from the preceeding person's link.
